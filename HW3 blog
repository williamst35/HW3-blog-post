I agree with pretty much everything in this chapter. Making the requirements the priority, having good communication
skills, staying up to date with technology, and being mature on decision making. These are all valuable traits for 
a successful programmer. I don't find anything confusing personally. I knew most of this stuff previously. The only thing
that kind of confused me was the "Eaten Worm" refrence. im still not quite sure what that means. As far as the rest of it
goes, it was interesting that taking more classes to stay up to date was reccomened. I feel like hands on work, and learnig 
from other new technology would be more efficient, but thats just my personal opinion. I do like how this book starts 
with these lessions though. Many books are so dense with knowleged they forget the human side of programming (mistakes, solutions,
communcation, etc)
